# ACCOUNT LEDGER CAPSTONE
This is my first coding capstone. I'm still learning how to code in Java so bear with me. ( :
### DETAILS
This project is a summary of what we have been learning in the past three weeks of coding. I used a csv file which basically tracked all transactions, whether it was adding a deposit, adding a payment etc. 
All in all this was a fun and challenging project.

# Experince
Overall this was a good learning experience, I hope to keep learning more and progressing more in this coding/tech space I'm still a noob. But I'm willing to learn and grow!!
